# Product Requirements Document: Modern Product Configurator

## Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for building a modern product configurator using the Embodee Product Viewer API. The configurator will serve as a showcase tool for Embodee's capabilities, allowing potential customers visiting embodee.com to experience the quality and functionality of the Embodee 3D product configuration system.

The configurator will be embedded into the Embodee.com website via iframe to demonstrate the company's API capabilities to potential customers. It should provide a simple, inviting experience that showcases all available customization features including colors, dynamic text, graphics upload, and materials.

## Goals

1. **Showcase Embodee's API Capabilities**: Demonstrate the full range of customization options available through the Embodee Product Viewer API
2. **Generate Lead Interest**: Create an engaging experience that encourages potential customers to request demos or contact Embodee
3. **Provide Technical Demonstration**: Show the quality and performance of Embodee's 3D rendering and real-time customization
4. **Enable Easy Integration**: Create a standalone application that can be embedded into any website via iframe
5. **Support Team Sports Focus**: Primarily showcase jersey customization while remaining flexible for other products

18. **API Integration**: The system must properly integrate with Embodee's Product Viewer API
19. **Data Fetching**: The system must fetch product data from the Embodee API using the provided workspaceID and productID

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **User Authentication**: No user accounts or login functionality required
2. **Shopping Cart**: No e-commerce functionality or purchase capabilities
3. **User Preferences**: No saving of user preferences or configurations
4. **Advanced Analytics**: No detailed user behavior tracking beyond basic engagement metrics
5. **Multi-language Support**: English only for initial version
6. **Offline Functionality**: Internet connection required for all features
7. **Advanced 3D Features**: No custom 3D model manipulation beyond API-supported options
8. **Social Sharing**: No social media integration or sharing features

## Design Considerations

### Visual Design
- **Clean and Minimal**: Design should not distract from the 3D product visualization
- **Professional Appearance**: Match Embodee's brand identity and convey technical competence
- **Modern UI Elements**: Use contemporary design patterns and smooth animations
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Organize customization options logically and intuitively

### User Experience
- **One-Product Focus**: Simple, single-product customization experience
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time 3D updates for all customizations
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show relevant options based on product data
- **Mobile-First**: Ensure excellent mobile experience

### Technical Design
- **Modular Architecture**: Component-based structure for maintainability
- **API-First Approach**: Design around Embodee API capabilities
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimize bundle size and optimize 3D asset loading
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling throughout the application

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- **Embodee Product Viewer API**: Core integration requirement
- **React Framework**: For component-based UI development
- **3D Rendering**: Embodee's embedded 3D viewer
- **HTTP Client**: For API communication with Embodee services

### Performance Requirements
- **Initial Load Time**: < 3 seconds for first 3D model display
- **Customization Response**: < 1 second for real-time updates
- **Mobile Performance**: Smooth operation on mid-range mobile devices
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized for fast loading in iframe context

### Browser Support
- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Mobile Browsers**: iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Mobile 90+
- **WebGL Support**: Required for 3D rendering

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
4. **Technical Performance**: Page load times and 3D rendering performance


## Open Questions

1. **Analytics Integration**: Should we implement Google Analytics or other tracking for user behavior analysis?
2. **Contact Form Integration**: How should we handle lead capture - separate form or integrated within configurator?
3. **Product Selection**: Should we support multiple products or focus on the single jersey demonstration?
4. **Custom Branding**: Should the configurator include Embodee branding or be white-label ready?
5. **API Rate Limits**: What are the expected usage patterns and do we need to implement rate limiting?
6. **Error Recovery**: What specific error scenarios should we handle and how should we guide users?
7. **Performance Monitoring**: Should we implement real-time performance monitoring for the 3D rendering?
8. **Accessibility**: What level of accessibility compliance is required for the configurator?
